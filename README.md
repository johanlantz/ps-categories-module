minicskeleton
=============

A module template for Prestashop v1.5.x.

This is a module template for Prestashop v1.5.x versions. Contains a basic markup to speed up module development.
The skeleton was created based on the latest [module creaton tutorial](http://doc.prestashop.com/display/PS15/Creating+a+PrestaShop+module).
Some things from the tutorial is skipped, some others are added, like the database manipulation, which I think is very usefull and easy to use.
